# Support-vector-Machine


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification and regression tasks. SVM is a powerful supervised learning model used to classify data by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes or by performing regression using support vectors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can vary depending on the problem (classification or regression). For classification tasks, datasets like the Iris dataset, MNIST, or any custom dataset can be used. For regression tasks, datasets involving continuous numerical values are suitable.

### Features (Classification Example)
- **Feature 1**: The first feature of the dataset.
- **Feature 2**: The second feature of the dataset.
- **Target**: The target label or class.

### Features (Regression Example)
- **Feature 1**: The first feature of the dataset.
- **Feature 2**: The second feature of the dataset.
- **Target**: The continuous value being predicted.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure
```
|-- dataset.csv         # CSV file containing the dataset
|-- svm_model.py        # Python script implementing the SVM algorithm
|-- README.md           # Project documentation (this file)
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
3. **Model Training**: The SVM model is trained using the `SVC` (for classification) or `SVR` (for regression) class from the `scikit-learn` library.
4. **Prediction**: The model predicts the target values (classification labels or regression output) for the test data.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or R-squared, depending on the task.

## Running the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/svm-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd svm-project
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python svm_model.py
   ```

## Example Output
For a classification task, the output will include the predicted class labels, and for regression, the predicted values. Performance metrics like accuracy, F1 score (for classification), or R-squared (for regression) will also be displayed.

## Visualization
If enabled, the script will generate plots such as:
- Decision boundaries for classification tasks.
- A comparison of actual vs predicted values for regression tasks.
